This weekâ€™s question: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order. 

Example:  

$ longestSubSeq([1, 9, 87, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2, 45]) 
$ 4 // 1, 3, 4, 2 

$ longestSubSeq ([36, 41, 56, 35, 91, 33, 34, 92, 43, 37, 42]) 
$ 5 // 36, 35, 33, 34, 37
